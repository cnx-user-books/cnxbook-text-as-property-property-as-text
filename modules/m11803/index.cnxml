    <note type="Editors' note" id="idm6397664"><label>Editors' note</label> The following text is taken from the
      <cite><cite-title>Proceedings of the Classical Association</cite-title></cite>, August
      1921, Vol XVIII.  The meetings were held from August 2nd to
      August 6th.  On the Morning of Thursday, August 4th, Alfred
      Edward (A.E.) Housman presented this paper.  The session was
      chaired by the President of the Association.  Numbers in square

    <para id="h1">
      In beginning to speak about the application of thought to
      textual criticism, I do not intend to define the term
      <emphasis>thought,</emphasis> because I hope that the sense
      which I attach to the word will emerge from what I say.  But it
      is necessary at the outset to define <emphasis>textual
      criticism,</emphasis> because many people, and even some people
      who profess to teach it to others, do not know what it is.  One
      sees books calling themselves introductions to textual criticism
      which contain nothing about textual criticism from beginning to
      end; which are all about palaeography and manuscripts and
      collation, and have no more to do with textual criticism than if
      they were all about accidence and syntax.  Palaeography is one of
      the things with which a textual critic needs to [68] acquaint
      himself, but grammar is another, and equally indispensable; and
      no amount either of grammar or of palaeography will teach a man
      one scrap of textual criticism.</para>

    <para id="h2">Textual criticism is a science, and, since it
    comprises recension and emendation, it is also an art.  It is the
    science of discovering error in texts and the art of removing
    it.  That is its definition, that is what the name
    <emphasis>denotes</emphasis>.  But I must also say something about
    what it does and does not <emphasis>connote</emphasis>, what
    attributes it does and does not imply; because here also there are
    false impressions abroad.
    </para>

    <para id="h3">First, then, it is not a sacred mystery.  It is
      purely a matter of reason and of common sense.  We exercise
      textual criticism whenever we notice and correct a misprint.  A
      man who possesses common sense and the use of reason must not
      expect to learn from treatises or lectures on textual criticism
      anything that he could not, with leisure and industry, find out
      for himself.  What the lectures and treatises can do for him is
      to save him time and trouble by presenting to him immediately
      considerations which would in any case occur to him sooner or
      later.  And whatever he reads about textual criticism in books,
      or hears at lectures, he should test by reason and common sense,
      and reject everything which conflicts with either as mere
      hocus-pocus.</para>

    <para id="h4">Secondly, textual criticism is not a branch of
    mathematics, nor indeed an exact science at all.  It deals with a
    matter not rigid and constant, like lines and numbers, but fluid
    and variable; namely the frailties and aberrations of the human
    mind, and of its insubordinate servants, the human fingers.  It
    therefore is not susceptible of hard-and-fast rules.  It would be
    much easier if it were; and that is why people try to pretend that
    it is, or at least behave as if they thought so.   Of course you can
    have hard-and-fast rules if you like, but then you will have false
    rules, and they will lead you wrong; because their simplicity will
    render them inapplicable to problems which are not simple, but
    complicated by the play of personality.  A textual critic [69]
    engaged upon his business is not at all like Newton investigating
    the motions of the planets: he is much more like a dog hunting for
    fleas.  If a dog hunted for fleas on mathematical principles,
    basing his researches on statistics of area and population, he
    would never catch a flea except by accident.  They require to be
    treated as individuals; and every problem which presents itself to
    the textual critic must be regarded as possibly unique.</para> 

    <para id="h5">Textual criticism therefore is neither mystery nor
    mathematics: it cannot be learnt either like the catechism or like
    the multiplication table.  This science and this art require more
    in the learner than a simply receptive mind; and indeed the truth
    is that they cannot be taught at all: <foreign>criticus nascitur,
    non fit</foreign>.  If a dog is to hunt for fleas successfully he
    must be quick and he must be sensitive.  It is no good for a
    rhinoceros to hunt for fleas: he does not know where they are, and
    could not catch them if he did.  It has sometimes been said that
    textual criticism is the crown and summit of all scholarship.  This
    is not evidently or necessarily true; but it is true that the
    qualities which make a critic, whether they are thus transcendent
    or no, are rare, and that a good critic is a much less common
    thing than for instance a good grammarian.  I have in my mind a
    paper by a well-known scholar on a certain Latin writer, half of
    which was concerned with grammar and half with criticism.  The
    grammatical part was excellent; it showed wide reading and
    accurate observation, and contributed matter which was both new
    and valuable.  In the textual part the author was like nothing so
    much as an ill-bred child interrupting the conversation of grown
    men.  If it was possible to mistake the question at issue, he
    mistook it.  If an opponent's arguments were contained in some book
    which was not at hand, he did not try to find the book, but he
    tried to guess the arguments; and he never succeeded.  If the book
    was at hand, and he had read the arguments, he did not understand
    them; and represented his opponents as saying the opposite of what
    they had said.  If another scholar had already removed a
    corrup-[70]tion by slightly altering the text, he proposed to
    remove it by altering the text violently.  So possible is it to be
    a learned man, and admirable in other departments, and yet to have
    in you not even the makings of a critic.  </para>

    <para id="h6"> But the application of thought to textual criticism
    is an action which ought to be within the power of anyone who can
    apply thought to anything.  It is not, like the talent for textual
    criticism, a gift of nature, but it is a habit; and, like other
    habits, it can be formed.  And, when formed, although it cannot
    fill the place of an absent talent, it can modify and minimise the
    ill effects of the talent's absence.  Because a man is not a born
    critic, he need not therefore act like a born fool; but when he
    engages in textual criticism he often does.  There are reasons for
    everything, and there are reasons for this; and I will now set
    forth the chief of them.  The <emphasis>fact</emphasis> that
    thought is not sufficiently applied to the subject I shall show
    hereafter by examples; but at present I consider the causes which
    bring that result about.
    </para>

    <para id="h7">First, then, not only is a natural aptitude for the
    study rare, but so also is a genuine interest in it.  Most people,
    and many scholars among them, find it rather dry and rather
    dull.  Now if a subject bores us, we are apt to avoid the trouble
    of thinking about it; but if we do that, we had better go further
    and avoid also the trouble of writing about it.  And that is what
    English scholars often did in the middle of the nineteenth
    century, when nobody in England wanted to hear about textual
    criticism.  This was not an ideal condition of affairs, but it had
    its compensation.  The less one says about a subject which one does
    not understand, the less one will say about it which is foolish;
    and on this subject editors were allowed by public opinion to be
    silent if they chose.  But public opinion is now aware that textual
    criticism, however repulsive, is nevertheless indispensable, and
    editors find that some presence of dealing with the subject is
    obligatory; and in these circumstances they apply, not thought,
    but words, to textual criticism.  They get rules by rote without
    grasping the realities of which those [71] rules are merely
    emblems, and recite them on inappropriate occasions instead of
    seriously thinking out each problem it arises.
    </para>

    <para id="h8">Secondly, it is only a minority of those who engage
    in this study who are sincerely bent upon the discovery of
    truth.  We all know that the discovery of truth is seldom the sole
    object of political writers; and the world believes, justly or
    unjustly, that it is not always the sole object of theologians:
    but the amount of sub-conscious dishonesty which pervades the
    textual criticism of the Greek and Latin classics is little
    suspected except by those who have had occasion to analyse
    it.  People come upon this field bringing with them prepossessions
    and preferences; they are not willing to look all facts in the
    face, nor to draw the most probable conclusion unless it is also
    the most agreeable conclusion.   Most men are rather stupid, and
    most of those who are not stupid are, consequently, rather vain;
    and it hardly possible to step aside from the pursuit of truth
    without falling a victim either to your stupidity or else to your
    vanity.  Stupidity will then attach you to received opinions, and
    you will stick in the mud; or vanity will set you hunting for
    novelty, and you will find mare's-nests.  Added to these snares and
    hindrances there are the various forms of partisanship:
    sectarianism, which handcuffs you to your own school and teachers
    and associates, and patriotism, which handcuffs you to your own
    country.  Patriotism has a great name as a virtue, and in civic
    matters, at the present stage of the world's history, it possibly
    still does more good than harm; but in the sphere of intellect it
    is an unmitigated nuisance.  I do not know which cuts the worse
    figure: a German scholar encouraging his countrymen to believe
    that "wir Deutsche" have nothing to learn from foreigners, or an
    Englishman demonstrating the unity of Homer by sneers at "Teutonic
    professors," who are supposed by his audience to have goggle eyes
    behind large spectacles, and ragged moustaches saturated in lager
    beer, and consequently to be incapable of forming literary
    judgments.  </para>

    <para id="h9">[72] Thirdly, these internal causes of error and
    folly are subject to very little counteraction or correction from
    outside.  The average reader knows hardly anything about textual
    criticism, and therefore cannot exercise a vigilant control over
    the writer: the addle-pate is at liberty to maunder and the
    impostor is at liberty to lie.  And, what is worse, the reader
    often shares the writer's prejudices, and is far too well pleased
    with his conclusions to examine either his premises or his
    reasoning.  Stand on a barrel in the streets of Bagdad, and say in
    a loud voice, "Twice two is four, and ginger is hot in the mouth,
    therefore Mohammed is the prophet of God," and your logic will
    probably escape criticism; or, if anyone by chance should
    criticise it, you could easily silence him by calling him a
    Christian dog. 
</para>
    <para id="h10">
    Fourthly, the things which the textual critic has to talk about
    are not things which present themselves clearly and sharply to the
    mind; and it is easy to say, and to fancy that you think, what you
    really do not think, and even what, if you seriously tried to
    think it, you would find to be unthinkable.  Mistakes are
    therefore made which could not be made if the matter under
    discussion were any corporeal object, having qualities perceptible
    to the senses.  The human senses have had a much longer history
    than the human intellect, and have been brought much nearer to
    perfection: they are far more acute, far less easy to deceive.
    The difference between an icicle and a red-hot poker is really
    much slighter than the difference between truth and falsehood or
    sense and nonsense; yet it is much more immediately noticeable and
    much more universally noticed, because the body is more sensitive
    than the mind.  I find therefore that a good way of exposing the
    falsehood of a statement or the absurdity of an argument in
    textual criticism is to transpose it into sensuous terms and see
    what it looks like then.  If the nouns which we use are the names
    of things which can be handled or tasted, differing from one
    another in being hot or cold, sweet or sour, then we realise what
    we are saying and take care what we say.  But [73] the terms of
    textual criticism are deplorably intellectual; and probably in no
    other field do men tell so many falsehoods in the idle hope that
    they are telling the truth, or talk so much nonsense in the vague
    belief that they are talking sense.</para>

    <para id="h11">This is particularly unfortunate and particularly
    reprehensible, because there is no science in which it is more
    necessary to take precautions against error arising from internal
    causes.  Those who follow the physical sciences enjoy the great
    advantage that they can constantly bring their opinions to the
    test of fact, and verify or falsify their theories by experiment.
    When a chemist has mixed sulphur and saltpetre and charcoal in
    certain proportions and wishes to ascertain if the mixture is
    explosive, he need only apply a match.  When a doctor has
    compounded a new drug and desires to find out what diseases, if
    any, it is good for, he has only to give it to his patients all
    round and notice which die and which recover.  Our conclusions
    regarding the truth or falsehood of a MS. reading can never be
    confirmed or corrected by an equally decisive test; for the only
    equally decisive test would be the production of the author's
    autograph.  The discovery merely of better and older MSS. than
    were previously known to us is <emphasis>not</emphasis> equally
    decisive; and even this inadequate verification is not to be
    expected often, or on a large scale.  It is therefore a matter of
    common prudence and common decency that we should neglect no
    safeguard lying within our reach; that we should look sharp after
    ourselves; that we should narrowly scrutinise our own proceedings
    and rigorously analyse our springs of action.  How far these
    elementary requirements are satisfied, we will now learn from
    examples.</para>

    <para id="h12">At the very beginning, to see what pure
    irrelevancy, what almost incredible foolishness, finds its way
    into print, take this instance.  It had been supposed for several
    centuries that Plautus' name was <foreign>M. Accius
    Plautus</foreign>, when Ritschl in 1845 pointed out that in the
    Ambrosian palimpsest discovered by Mai in 1815, written in the
    [74] fourth or fifth century, and much the oldest of Plautus'
    MSS., the name appears in the genitive as <foreign>T.  Macci
    Plauti</foreign>, so that he was really called <foreign>Titus
    Maccius</foreign> (or <foreign>Maccus</foreign>)
    <foreign>Plautus</foreign>.  An Italian scholar, one Vallauri,
    objected to this innovation on the ground that in all printed
    editions from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century the name was
    <foreign>M. Accius</foreign>.  He went to Milan to look at the
    palimpsest, and there, to be sure, he found
    <foreign>T. Macci</foreign> quite legibly written.  But he
    observed that many other pages of the MS. were quite illegible,
    and that the whole book was very much tattered and battered;
    whereupon he said that he could not sufficiently wonder at anyone
    attaching any weight to a MS. which was in such a condition.  Is
    there any other science, anything calling itself a science, into
    which such intellects intrude and conduct such operations in
    public?  But you may think that Mr. Vallauri is a unique
    phenomenon.  No: if you engage in textual criticism you may come
    upon a second Mr. Vallauri any turn.  The MSS. of Catullus, none
    of them older than the fourteenth century, present at 64. 23 the
    verse:

      <quote display="block" id="idp60096"><foreign> heroes saluete, deum genus! o bona
      mater!</foreign></quote>

    The Veronese scholia on Vergil, a palimpsest of the fifth or sixth
    century, at <foreign>Aen</foreign>. v. 80, "salue sancte
    parens," have the note: "Catullus: saluete, deum
    <emphasis>gens</emphasis>, o bona matrum | progenies, saluete
    iter[um]"—giving <foreign>gens</foreign> for genus,
    <foreign>matrum</foreign> for <foreign>mater</foreign>, and adding
    a half-verse absent from Catullus' MSS.; and scholars have
    naturally preferred an authority so much more ancient.  But one
    editor is found to object: "the weight of the Veronese
    scholia, imperfect and full of lacunae as they are, is not to be
    set against our MSS." There is Mr. Vallauri over again:
    because the palimpsest has large holes elsewhere and because much
    of it has perished, therefore what remains, though written as
    early as the sixth century, has less authority than MSS. written
    in the fourteenth.  If however anyone gets hold of these
    fourteenth-century MSS., destroys pages of them and tears holes in
    the pages he [75] does not destroy, the authority of those parts
    which he allows to survive will presumably deteriorate, and may
    even sink as low as that of the palimpsest. </para>

    <para id="h13"> Again.  There are two MSS. of a certain author,
      which we will call A and B. Of these two it is recognised that A
      is the more correct but the less sincere, and that B is the more
      corrupt but the less interpolated.  It is desired to know which
      MS., if either, is better than the other, or whether both are
      equal.  One scholar tries to determine this question by the
      collection and comparison of examples.  But another thinks that
      he knows a shorter way than that; and it consists in saying
      "the more sincere MS. is and must be for any critic who
      understands his business the better MS."</para>

   <para id="h14"> This I cite as a specimen of the things which
   people may say if they do not think about the meaning of what they
   are saying, and especially as an example of the danger of dealing
   in generalisations.  The best way to treat such pretentious
   inanities is to transfer them from the sphere of textual criticism,
   where the difference between truth and falsehood or between sense
   and nonsense is little regarded and seldom even perceived, into
   some sphere where men are obliged to use concrete and sensuous
   terms, which force them, however reluctantly, to think.
</para>

    <para id="h15">I ask this scholar, this critic who knows his
      business, and who says that the more sincere of two MSS.  is and
      must be the better—I ask him to tell me which weighs most, a
      tall man or a fat man.  He cannot answer; nobody can; everybody
      sees in a moment that the question is absurd.
      <emphasis>Tall</emphasis> and <emphasis>fat</emphasis> are
      adjectives which transport even a textual critic from the world
      of humbug into the world of reality, a world inhabited by
      comparatively thoughtful people, such as butchers and grocers,
      who depend on their brains for their bread.  There he begins to
      understand that to such general questions any answer must be
      false; that judgment can only be pronounced on individual
      specimens; that everything depends on the degree of tallness and
      the degree of fatness.  It may well be that an inch of girth
      [76] adds more weight than an inch of height, or vice versa; but
      that altitude is incomparably more ponderous than obesity, or
      obesity than altitude, and that an inch of one depresses the
      scale more than a yard of the other, has never been maintained.
      The way to find out whether this tall man weighs more or less
      than that fat man is to weigh them; and the way to find out
      whether this corrupt MS. is better or worse than that
      interpolated MS. is to collect and compare their readings; not
      to ride easily off on the false and ridiculous generalisation
      that the more sincere MS. is and must be the better.
</para>

    <para id="h16">When you call a MS. <emphasis>sincere</emphasis>
    you instantly engage on its behalf the moral sympathy of the
    thoughtless: moral sympathy is a line in which they are very
    strong.  I do not desire to exclude morality from textual
    criticism; I wish indeed that some moral qualities were commoner
    in textual criticism than they are; but let us not indulge our
    moral emotions out of season.  It may be that a scribe who
    interpolates, who makes changes deliberately, is guilty of
    wickedness, while a scribe who makes changes accidentally, because
    he is sleepy or illiterate or drunk, is guilty of none; but that
    is a question which will be determined by a competent authority at
    the Day of Judgment, and is no concern of ours.  Our concern is
    not with the eternal destiny of the scribe, but with the temporal
    utility of the MS.; and a MS. is useful or the reverse in
    proportion to the amount of truth which it discloses or conceals,
    no matter what may be the causes of the disclosure or concealment.
    It is a mistake to suppose that deliberate change is always or
    necessarily more destructive of truth than accidental change; and
    even if it were, the main question, as I have said already, is one
    of degree.  A MS. in which 1 per cent. of the words have been
    viciously and intentionally altered and 99 per cent. are right is
    not so bad as a MS. in which only 1 per cent. are right and 99 per
    cent. have been altered virtuously and unintentionally; and if you
    go to a critic with any such vague inquiry as the question whether
    the "more sincere" or the "more [77] correct"
    of two MSS. is the better, he will reply, "If I am to answer
    that question, you must show me the two MSS. first; for aught that
    I know at present, from the terms of your query, either may be
    better than the other, or both may be equal." But that is
    what the incompetent intruders into criticism can never admit.
    They <emphasis>must</emphasis> have a better MS., whether it
    exists or no; because they could never get along without one.  If
    Providence permitted two MSS. to be equal, the editor would have
    to choose between their readings by considerations of intrinsic
    merit, and in order to do that he would need to acquire
    intelligence and impartiality and willingness to take pains, and
    all sorts of things which he neither has nor wishes for; and he
    feels sure that God, who tempers the wind to the shorn lamb, can
    never have meant to lay upon his shoulders such a burden as this.
    </para>

    <para id="h17">This is thoughtlessness in the sphere of recension:
    come now to the sphere of emendation.  There is one foolish sort
    of conjecture which seems to be commoner in the British Isles than
    anywhere else, though it is also practiced abroad, and of late
    years especially at Munich.  The practice is, if you have
    persuaded yourself that a text is corrupt, to alter a letter or
    two and see what happens.  If what happens is anything which the
    warmest good-will can mistake for sense and grammar, you call it
    an emendation; and you call this silly game the palaeographical
    method. </para>

    <para id="h18">The palaeographical method has always been the
    delight of tiros and the scorn of critics.  Haupt, for example,
    used to warn his pupils against mistaking this sort of thing for
    emendation.  "The prime requisite of a good emendation,"
    said he, "is that it should start from the thought; it is
    only afterwards that other considerations, such as those of metre
    or possibilities, such as the interchange of letters, are taken
    into account." And again: "If the sense requires it, I
    am prepared to write <emphasis>Constantinopolitanus</emphasis>
    where the MSS.  have the monosyllabic interjection
    <emphasis>o</emphasis>." And again: "From the
    requirement that one should [78] always begin with the thought,
    there results, as is self-evident, the negative aspect of the
    case, that one should not, at the outset, consider what exchange
    of letters may possibly have brought about the corruption of the
    passage one is dealing with." And further, in his oration on
    Lachmann as a critic: "Some people, if they see that anything
    in an ancient text wants correcting, immediately betake themselves
    to the art of palaeography, investigate the shapes of letters and
    the forms of abbreviation, and try one dodge after another, as if
    it were a game, until they hit upon something which they think
    they can substitute for the corruption; as if forsooth truth were
    generally discovered by shots of that sort, or as if emendation
    could take its rise from anything but a careful consideration of
    the thought." </para>

    <para id="h19">But even when palaeography is kept in her proper
    place, as handmaid, and not allowed to give herself the airs of
    mistress, she is apt to be overworked.  There is a preference for
    conjectures which call in the aid of palaeography, and which
    assume, as the cause of error, the accidental interchange of
    similar letters or similar words, although other causes of error
    are known to exist.  One is presented, for instance, with the
    following maxim: "Interpolation is, speaking generally,
    comparatively an uncommon source of alteration, and we should
    therefore be loth to assume it in a given case." </para>

    <para id="h20">Every case is a given case; so what this maxim
    really means is that we should always be loth to assume
    interpolation as a source of alteration.  But it is certain, and
    admitted by this writer when he uses the phrase "comparatively
    uncommon," that interpolation does occur; so he is telling us that
    we should be loth to assume interpolation even when that
    assumption is true.  And the reason why we are to behave in this
    ridiculous manner is that interpolation is, speaking generally,
    comparatively an uncommon source of alteration. </para>

    <para id="h21">Now to detect a <emphasis>non sequitur</emphasis>,
    unless it leads to an unwelcome conclusion, is as much beyond the
    power of [79] the average reader as it is beyond the power of the
    average writer to attach ideas to his own words when those words
    are terms of textual criticism.  I will therefore substitute other
    terms, terms to which ideas must be attached; and I invite
    consideration of this maxim and this ratiocination:

      <quote display="block" id="idp2405952">    "A bullet-wound is, speaking
      generally, comparatively an uncommon cause of death, and we
      should therefore be loth to assume it in a given
      case."</quote> 

      Should we? Should we be loth to assume a bullet-wound as the cause of
      death if the given case were death on a battlefield? and should
      we be loth to do so for the reason alleged, that a bullet-wound
      is, speaking generally, comparatively an uncommon cause of
      death? Ought we to assume instead the commonest cause of death,
      and assign death on a battlefield to tuberculosis? What would be
      thought of a counsellor who enjoined that method of procedure?
      Well, it would probably be thought that he was a textual critic
      strayed from home.</para> 

    <para id="h22"><emphasis>Why</emphasis> is interpolation
    comparatively uncommon? For the same reason that bullet-wounds
    are: because the opportunity for it is comparatively uncommon.
    Interpolation is provoked by real or supposed difficulties, and is
    not frequently volunteered where all is plain sailing; whereas
    accidental alteration may happen anywhere.  Every letter of every
    word lies exposed to it, and that is the sole reason why
    accidental alteration is more common.  In a given case where
    either assumption is possible, the assumption of interpolation is
    equally probable, nay more probable; because action with a motive
    is more probable than action without a motive.  The truth
    therefore is that in such a case we should be loth to assume
    accident and should rather assume interpolation; and the
    circumstance that such cases are comparatively uncommon is no
    reason for behaving irrationally when they occur. </para>

    <para id="h23">There is one special province of textual criticism,
    a large and important province, which is concerned with [80] the
    establishment of rules of grammar and of metre.  Those rules are
    in part traditional, and given us by the ancient grammarians; but
    in part they are formed by our own induction from what we find in
    the MSS. of Greek and Latin authors; and even the traditional
    rules must of course be tested by comparison with the witness of
    the MSS.  But every rule, whether traditional or framed from
    induction, is sometimes broken by the MSS.; it may be by few, it
    may be by many; it may be seldom, it may be often; and critics may
    then say that the MSS.  are wrong and may correct them in
    accordance with the rule. The state of affairs is apparently, nay
    evidently, paradoxical. The MSS. are the material upon which we
    base our rule, and then, when we have got our rule, we turn round
    upon the MSS. and say that the rule, based upon them, convicts
    them of error. We are thus working in a circle, that is a fact
    which there is no denying; but, as Lachmann says, the task of the
    critic is just this, to tread that circle deftly and warily; and
    that is precisely what elevates the critic's business above mere
    mechanical labour. The difficulty is one which lies in the nature
    of the case, and is inevitable; and the only way to surmount it is
    just to be a critic.</para> 
  

    <para id="h24">The paradox is more formidable in appearance than
    in reality, and has plenty of analogies in daily life. In a trial
    or lawsuit the jury's verdict is mainly based upon the evidence of
    the witnesses; but that does not prevent the jury from making up
    its mind, from the evidence in general, that one or more witnesses
    have been guilty of perjury and that their evidence is to be
    disregarded.  It is quite possible to elicit from the general
    testimony of MSS. a rule of sufficient certainty to convict of
    falsehood their exceptional testimony, or of sufficient
    probability to throw doubt upon it.  But that exceptional testimony
    must in each case be considered. It must be recognised that there
    are two hypotheses between which we have to decide: the question
    is whether the exceptions come from the author, and so break down
    the rule, or whether they come from the scribe, and are to be
    corrected by it: [81] and in order to decide this we must keep our
    eyes open for any peculiarity which may happen to characterise
    them. </para>

    <para id="h25">One of the forms which lack of thought has assumed
    in textual criticism is the tendency now prevailing, especially
    among some Continental scholars, to try to break down accepted
    rules of grammar or metre by the mere collection and enumeration
    of exceptions presented by the MSS.  Now that can never break down
    a rule: the mere number of exceptions is nothing; what matters is
    their weight, and that can only be ascertained by classification
    and scrutiny.  If I had noted down every example which I have met,
    I should now have a large collection of places in Latin MSS. where
    the substantive <foreign>orbis</foreign>, which our grammars and
    dictionaries declare to be masculine, has a feminine adjective
    attached to it. But I do not therefore propose to revise that rule
    of syntax, for examination would show that these examples, though
    numerous, have no force. Most of them are places where the sense
    and context show that <foreign>orbis</foreign>, in whatever case
    or number it may be, is merely a corruption of the corresponding
    case and number of <foreign>urbs</foreign>; and in the remaining
    places it is natural to suppose that the scribe has been
    influenced and confused by the great likeness of the one word to
    the other.  Or again, read Madvig,
    <cite><cite-title><emphasis>Adu. Crit.</emphasis></cite-title></cite>, vol. I, book i,
    chap. iv, where he sifts the evidence for the opinion that the
    aorist infinitive can be used in Greek after verbs of saying and
    thinking in the sense of the future infinitive or of the aorist
    infinitive with

      <foreign>ά̕<!-- would be &#x0313; but the letter
      already has an accent-->ν {an}. </foreign>

      The list of examples in the MSS. is very long
    indeed; but the moment you begin to sort them and examine them you
    are less struck by their umber than by the restriction of their
    extent. Almost all of them are such as 



      <foreign>δέξασθαι
      {dexasthai} </foreign>

used for

      <foreign>δέξεσθαι
      {dexesthai} </foreign>

where the two forms differ by one letter only; a
    smaller number are such as 

      <foreign>ποιη̑σαι
      {poiesai} </foreign>

for 

      <foreign>ποιήσειν{poiesein}
      </foreign>

    where the difference, though greater, is still slight; others are
    examples like 

      <foreign>ή̔κιστα
      ἀναγκαασθη̑ναι
      {ekist' anagkasthenai} </foreign>

for 

      <foreign>ή̔κισττ’   ά̕<!-- would be &#x0313; but the letter
      already has an accent-->ν
      ἀναγκασθη̑ναι
      {ekist' an anagkasthenai},</foreign>

    where again the difference is next to nothing. Now if the MSS. are
    right in these cases, and the Greek authors did use this [82]
    construction, how are we to explain this extraordinary limitation
    of the use? There is no syntactical difference between the first
    and second aorist: why then did they use the 1st aorist so often
    for the future and the 2nd aorist so seldom? why did they say
    
      <foreign>δέξασθαι
      {dexasthai}</foreign>

for 

      <foreign>δέξεσθαι
      {dexesthai} </foreign>

dozens of times and 

      <foreign>λαβει̑ν
      {labein} </foreign>

for 

      <foreign>λήψεσθαι
      {lepsesthai} </foreign>

    never? The mere asking of that question is enough to show the true
    state of the case. The bare fact that the aorists thus used in the
    MSS. are aorists of similar <emphasis>form</emphasis> to the
    future, while aorists of dissimilar form are not thus used, proves
    that the phenomenon has its cause in the copyist's eye and not in
    the author's mind, that it is not a variation in grammatical usage
    but an error in transcription. The number of examples is nothing;
    all depends upon their character; and a single example of 

      <foreign>λαβει̑ν
      {labein} </foreign>

    in a future sense would have more weight than a hundred of

      <foreign>δέξασθαι
      {dexasthai} </foreign>

</para>

    <para id="h26">In particular, scribes will alter a less familiar
    form to a more familiar, if they see nothing to prevent them. If
    metre allows, or if they do not know that metre forbids, they will
    alter 

      <foreign>ἐλεινός
      {eleinos} </foreign>

to

      <foreign>ἐλεεινός
      {eleeinos},</foreign>

      <foreign>οἰστός {oistos}

      Since metre convicts them of infidelity in some places, they
      forfeit the right to be trusted in any place; if we choose to
      trust them we are credulous, and if we build structures on our
      trust we are no critics. Even if metre does not convict them,
      reason sometimes can. Take the statement, repeatedly made in
      grammars and editions, that the Latins sometimes used the
      pluperfect for the imperfect and the perfect. They did use it
      for the imperfect; they used it also for the preterite or past
      aorist; but for the perfect they did not use it; and that is
      proved by the very examples of its use as perfect which are
      found in MSS. All those examples are of the 3rd person
      plural. Why? We must choose between the two following
      hypotheses:

      <list id="list1">
	<item>(a) That the Latins used the pluperfect for the perfect
   in the 3rd person plural only.</item> 
	<item> (b) That they did not use the pluperfect for the
   perfect, and that these examples are corrupt.</item>
      </list></para>

      <para id="h27">[83] If anyone adopted the former, he would have
      to explain what syntactical property, inviting the author to use
      pluperfect for perfect, is possessed by the 3rd person plural
      and not by the two other plural or the three singular persons:
      and I should like to see some one set about it. </para>

      <para id="h28">If we adopt the latter, we must show what
      <emphasis>external</emphasis> feature, inviting the
      <emphasis>scribe</emphasis> to write pluperfect for perfect, is
      possessed by the 3rd person plural exclusively: and that is
      quite easy. The 3rd person plural is the only person in which
      the perfect and the pluperfect differ merely by one letter.
      Moreover in verse the perfect termination
      <foreign>-ěrunt</foreign>, being comparatively unfamiliar
      to scribes, is altered by them to the nearest familiar form with
      the same scansion, sometimes <foreign>-erint</foreign>,
      sometimes <foreign>-erant</foreign>: in Ovid's
      <foreign>Heroides</foreign> there are four places where the best
      MS. gives <foreign>praebuěrunt</foreign>,
      <foreign>stetěrunt</foreign>,
      <foreign>exciděrunt</foreign>,
      <foreign>expulěrunt</foreign>, and the other MSS. give
      <foreign>-erant</foreign> or <foreign>-erint</foreign> or both.
      Accordingly, when the much inferior MSS. of Propertius present
      pluperfect for perfect in four places,
      <foreign>fuerant</foreign> once, <foreign>steterant</foreign>
      once, <foreign>exciderant</foreign> twice, Scaliger corrects to
      <foreign>fuěrunt</foreign>,
      <foreign>stetěrunt</foreign>,
      <foreign>exciděrunt</foreign>.  Thereupon an editor of
      this enlightened age takes up his pen and writes as follows:
      "It is quite erroneous to remove the pluperfects where it
      can be done without great expenditure of conjectural sagacity
      (<foreign>steterunt</foreign> for <foreign>steterant</foreign>
      and the like), and not to trouble oneself about the phenomenon
      elsewhere." I ask, how is it possible to trouble oneself
      about the phenomenon elsewhere? It does not exist elsewhere.
      There is no place where the MSS. give
      <foreign>steteram</foreign> in the sense of the perfect
      <foreign>steti</foreign>, nor <foreign>steteras</foreign> in the
      sense of the perfect <foreign>stetisti</foreign>. Wherever they
      give examples of the pluperfect which cannot be removed by the
      change of one letter—such as <foreign>pararat</foreign> in
      i. 8. 36 or <foreign>fueram</foreign> in i. 12. 11—those are
      examples where it has sometimes the sense of the imperfect,
      sometimes the preterite, but never of the perfect. And the
      inference is plain: the Latins did not use the pluperfect for
      the perfect. </para>

    <para id="h29">Scaliger knew that in the sixteenth century:
     Mr. [84] Rothstein, in the nineteenth and twentieth, does not
     know it; he has found a form of words to prevent him from knowing
     it, and he thinks himself in advance of Scaliger.  It is supposed
     that there has been progress in the science of textual criticism,
     and the most frivolous pretender has learnt to talk
     superciliously about "the old unscientific days." The
     old unscientific days are everlasting, they are here and now;
     they are renewed perennially by the ear which takes formulas in,
     and the tongue which gives them out again, and the mind which
     meanwhile is empty of reflexion and stuffed with
     self-complacency.  Progress there has been, but where?  In
     superior intellects: the rabble do not share it.  Such a man as
     Scaliger, living in our time, would be a better critic than
     Scaliger was; but we shall not be better critics than Scaliger by
     the simple act of living in our own time.  Textual criticism,
     like most other sciences, is an aristocratic affair, not
     communicable to all men, nor to most men.  Not to be a textual
     critic is no reproach to anyone, unless he pretends to be what he
     is not.  To <emphasis>be</emphasis> a textual critic requires
     aptitude for thinking and willingness to think; and though it
     also requires other things, those things are supplements and
     cannot be substitutes.  Knowledge is good, method is good, but
     one thing beyond all others is necessary; and that is to have a
     head, not a pumpkin, on your shoulders and brains, not pudding,
     in your head.  </para>
